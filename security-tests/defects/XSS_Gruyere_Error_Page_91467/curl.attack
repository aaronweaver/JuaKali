Feature: Launch curl attack

Background:
  Given "curl" is installed
  And the following profile:
  #Change the Gruyere instance to an instance that your start or reference a local install of gruyere
    | name     | value      |
    | hostname | https://google-gruyere.appspot.com/149521394764 |

Scenario: Verify that XSS does not exist on the error page
  When I launch a "curl" attack with:
    """
    curl --silent '<hostname>/out/<script>alert(1)</script>'
    """
  #XSS on error page
  Then the output should not contain:
    """
    <script>alert
    """
