Feature: Launch curl defect

Background:
  Given "curl" is installed
  And the following profile:
  #Change the Gruyere instance to an instance that your start or reference a local install of gruyere
    | name     | value      |
    | hostname | google-gruyere.appspot.com/149521394764 |

Scenario: Should not contain the database dump
  When I launch a "curl" attack with:
    """
    curl --silent 'http://<hostname>/dump.gtl'
    """
  #check for the  attack
  Then the output should not contain:
    """
    {'administrator'
    """
